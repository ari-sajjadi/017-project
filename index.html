  <h1 class="animated shake infinite">Attention</h1>
    <p class="pointer-slideshow">One day a student was taking a very difficult essay exam. At the end of the test, the prof asked all the students to put their pencils down and immediately hand in their tests. The young man kept writing furioulsy, although he was warned that if he did not stop immediately he would be disqualified. He ignored the warning, finished the test 10 minutes later, and went to hand the test to his instructor. The instructor told him he would not take the test.
    The student asked, "Do you know who I am?" The prof said, "No and I don't care."The student asked again, "Are you sure you don't know who I am?"The prof again said no. So the student walked over to the pile of tests, placed his in the middle, then threw the papers in the air.
        "Good" the student said, and walked out. He passed. </p>
    <p class="pointer-slideshow">A woman got on a bus, holding a baby.The bus driver said, "That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen."In a huff, the woman slammed her fare into the fare box and took an aisle seat near the rear of the bus.The man seated next to her sensed that she was agitated and asked her what was wrong."The bus driver insulted me," she fumed.The man sympathized and said, "Why, he's a public servant and shouldn't say things to insult passengers.""You're right," she said. "I think I'll go back up there and give him a piece of my mind.""That's a good idea," the man said. "Here, let me hold your monkey."  </p>
    <p class="pointer-slideshow">James was walking down the road one morning when he met his riend Danny."Morning, Danny. Er ... Danny, you're wearing a glove on one hand and none on the other. Did you know?" "Yes, well I heard the weather forecast this morning, you see." "The Weather forecast?" "Yes, the weather forecast. the forecaster said on the one hand it might be fine but on the other hand there might be some rain."(Cantonese students have problems with "on the other hand" because there is a similar expression in Cantonese that means "in addition". This joke helps highlight the contrast implied.)  </p>
    <p class="pointer-slideshow">"Dad, I don't want to go to school today." said the boy.
    "Why not, son?"       "Well, one of the chickens on the school farm died last week and we had chicken soup for lunch the next day. Then three days ago one of the pigs died and we had roast pork the next day."      "But why don't you want to go today?"      "Because our English teacher died yesterday!" </p>
    <p class="pointer-slideshow">A man was driving at 80 kph one day when he was passed by a 3-legged chicken. He accelerated and passed the chicken. Three minutes later the chicken passed him again as he was driving at 100 kph. The man tried to catch the chicken but it ran down a side road. The man followed it into a farmyard but couldn't find it anywhere. He saw the farmer and told him the story and the man asked for an explanation. The farmer said that he, his wife and his son all liked chicken legs so he bred 3-legged chickens.
    "What do they taste like?" asked the man.
            
    "I don't know", replied the farmer, "we haven't caught one yet" </p>
