      <p class="pointer-slideshow columns-3">One day a student was taking a very difficult essay exam. At the end of the
        test, the prof asked all the students to put their pencils down and immediately hand in their tests. The young
        man kept writing furioulsy, although he was warned that if he did not stop immediately he would be disqualified.
        He ignored the warning, finished the test 10 minutes later, and went to hand the test to his instructor. The
        instructor told him he would not take the test.
        The student asked, "Do you know who I am?" The prof said, "No and I don't care."The student asked again, "Are
        you sure you don't know who I am?"The prof again said no. So the student walked over to the pile of tests,
        placed his in the middle, then threw the papers in the air.
        "Good" the student said, and walked out. He passed.

      <p class="pointer-slideshow columns-3">James was walking down the road one morning when he met his riend
        Danny."Morning, Danny. Er ... Danny, you're wearing a glove on one hand and none on the other. Did you know?"
        "Yes, well I heard the weather forecast this morning, you see." "The Weather forecast?" "Yes, the weather
        forecast. the forecaster said on the one hand it might be fine but on the other hand there might be some
        rain."(Cantonese students have problems with "on the other hand" because there is a similar expression in
        Cantonese that means "in addition". This joke helps highlight the contrast implied.)
